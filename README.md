# SettingsFileExamples
This plugin is built as an example for each of the BakkesMod plugin settings file components.

A description of the formatting and purpose of each component can be found in the .cpp file. Look at the .set file to see each component in action.

The wiki contains much of the same information if you would like a quicker reference point: https://bakkesmod.fandom.com/wiki/Plugin_settings_files
